Hey there! Thanks a lot for playing this.

Fullscreen might help. But please don't scroll out of the City, it doesn't like when you do that :(
To start the game, right-click on the Main class and run void main().
You have 6 seconds to press "Start" and click onto the screen before the aliens start shooting.
    You should be ready to move, as the middle alien might be the first shoot.

        A: Move Left
        D: Move Right
        W: Shoot
        Spacebar: Shoot

The goal of the game is to shoot and kill all the aliens without being shot yourself. In the original, there are more aliens,
    but you also have three lives. To make mine a similar difficulty, there are only 18 aliens,
    but the player has only one life â€” you die; it's over.
Use the Bulwarks to block aliens' bullets (they will block yours, too, though).
The game ends either when you defeat all the aliens or you get shot by one.

Best of luck, and have fun!
